================ Revision history ============================================
5.0.0:
 - Update to use em_core instead of em_int to implement critical regions.
 - TEMPDRV: Errata fix is now using calibration values to initialize the
   temperature transition points.
 - TEMPDRV: Errata fix is initiated on Pearl and Jade devices in addition
   to the EFR32 devices.
 - UARTDRV: Fixed issue with LEUART on low frequencies.
 - UARTDRV: Fixed issue with UARTDRV_Abort() where buffers weren't dequeued.
 - Configuration files moved from emdrv\config\ to emdrv\<driver>\config\
 - RTCDRV: Interrupt handler updated to only process interrupts that are enabled.
   This prevents potential deadlocks.
 - NVM: Fixed definition of error codes to use ECODE_EMDRV_NVM_BASE.

4.4.0:
 - UARTDRV: Fix race condition for GPIO flow control.
 - RTCDRV: Fixed bug where a high remaining time could cause an incorrect
   result from the RTCDRV_TimeRemaining function.
 - UARTDRV: Added support for LEUART peripherals using the UARTDRV_InitLeuart()
   init function.

4.3.1:
 - UARTDRV: Added support for pausing and resuming active transmit operations.
 - UARTDRV: SW flow control bytes now interrupt the active transmit operation to
   ensure timely delivery.
 - UARTDRV: Added support for setting the peer flow control state for manual SW
   flow control management.
 - UARTDRV: Fixed multiple instances of NULL pointer dereferencing.

4.3.0:
 - UARTDRV: Added support for a new flow control mode which is using the built
   in hardware flow control capabilities on platform 2 devices. The new flow
   control mode is called "uartdrvFlowControlHwUart"
 - UARTDRV: Fixed bug where tx bytes could be dropped when using the flow
   control mode called "uartdrvFlowControlHw".
 - SLEEP driver will no longer allow blocking of EM1 energy mode.
 - EZRADIODRV now supports Si4468 radio based parts.
 - Made ezradio_comm_GetResp non-blocker in EZRADIODRV.
 - Made ezradio_comm_PollCTS non-blocker if used together with GPIO1 in EZRADIODRV.
 - EZRADIODRV transmit and receive plugins use the generated channel number instead of the 0.
 - EZRADIODRV now supports 4-wire SPI mode (not available for EZR32 based devices).

4.2.3:
 - DMADRV added functions for pausing and resuming a DMA transfer
 - UARTDRV changed the way an ongoing transfer is stopped when the CTS pin
   goes high.

4.2.1:
 - No changes.

4.2.0:
 - Added TEMPDRV, a temperature sensor driver.

4.1.1:
 - NVM Wear-Leveling driver page headers re-organized to have natural alignment.
   Reads are therefore done as as aligned accesses only. The offset of the version member in the
   header is maintained.
 - NVM driver is updated to work with SCB_CCR_UNALIGN_TRP enabled.
 - NVM driver version (in headers) incremented from 2 to 3.
 - NVMHAL code disabled by default (in #if blocks) is removed.
 - NVM driver code and documentation is updated.

4.1.0:
 - EZRADIODRV now supports the plugin system layer. Transmit, receive, CRC
   error, auto acknowledge, PN9, direct receive, direct transmit and unmodulated
   carrier plugins are added.
 - EZRADIODRV now supports Si4461 radio based parts.
 - EZRADIODRV radio API layer is reworked.
 - Updated EZRADIODRV documentation and examples.

4.0.0:
 - In GPIOINTERRUPT, fixed race condition in GPIOINT_IRQDispatcher.

3.20.13:
 - Removed obsolete include statement in EZRADIODRV.

3.20.12:
 - Changes and bugfixes in all drivers.

3.20.5:
 - Added RTCDRV and SPIDRV drivers.
 - All NVM driver configuration parameters moved to emdrv\config\nvm_config.h and nvm_config.c
 - NVM driver now uses Ecode error codes.
 - Updated NVM driver documentation and example.
 - Updated GPIOINT driver documentation.

3.20.2:
 - Added SLEEP driver.

3.20.0:
 - First version with NVM and GPIOINTERRUPT drivers.
